# [Last.fm](//lastfm.pewpew.nl)

## Brief

This Wob Applicationâ„¢ is an Angular demo, as a clone of the official
Last.fm Web application. Also it is a showcase of my ability to complement my
Job application for the Web Developer position at Last.fm.

## Principles

* It is a one-page app.
* Everything clickable should work as expected.
* The code is written without demo comprimises, including documentation and
  tests. (TODO: tests)

  The framework
* [Angular UI](//angular-ui.github.io)

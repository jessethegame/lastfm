#Bio

My family name is Jesse Kwabena Zwaan. My Dutch mother safely delivered of
baby-me on the 6th of December 1988, which makes me 24 as of writing.
Kwabena means this day was a Tuesday in Ghana, the homeland of my father.

I was a bright kid from first elementary grade, which I skipped. It
was at grammar school that I discovered a passion for programming, when
presented with a TI 83+ calculator. I spent most of the following
classes building games on it. Studying computer science was an obvious
continuation although mathematics was a close contender.

As school did not require much energy, most of my unscheduled time was spent
on computer games. Sadly back then there was not much societal acceptance of
e-sports so I never felt comfortable taking it truly serious. I bet that these
days I would have been a zealous League of Legends or Starcraft 2 warrior.
However, my monomaniacal focus shifted right before this era. Moving away from
actual games made me realise how much I (still) understand the world as a symphony of game mechanics.

My father came to europe with his band. I saw them play throughout my youth.
Later he ran a music production studio in our basement. Josephine (my sister
also known as the very talented singer Afua Futura) and I adopted this studio
to explore our own musicality, both recording and producing. The history also
gave us natural affinity for the stage. I never truly entertained this
trait until I spontaneously decided to try [X-Factor][1]. To ample success.
I managed to reach the first liveshow and got a nice peek into the entertainment
industry.

The X-Factor journey greatly disturbed my already dragging study progress and
the contact with *the real world* showed me the possibilities out there.
Academical Computer Science is important, but arcane and static. It covers
critical basic concepts of correctness, complexity and security, but lacks flux
of <abbr title="For the true geeks, yes I did card games too. I was a fanatic Magic the Gathering player and competed in Nationals multiple times.">accumulated knowledge</abbr> and notions of innovation and social influence. I dropped out with 2/3rd study credits pocketed and started my freelance company *pewpew ict*.

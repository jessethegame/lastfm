#Jesse the Game
World domination. I have devised a scheme for this specific purpose, which I am
not only willing to share with you, but offering you to be a part of. The
scheme is seeded by the premise that you need an army of loyal minions to
dominate the world.

People love music. People love games. People think computer science is magic.
These happen to be the three subjects I identify myself with. These are also
the three psychological hacks I intend to abuse in one entertainment experience:

<strong>Jesse the Game</strong>

The game is about power. The power to control a pop-music artist the way Mario
and Link dance to the tips of your fingers. I will expose myself as a playable
real-life game character, Jesse the Game; who has built the entire thing by
hand.

Power comes at a price. The mechanics of this game form a progressive attention
cycle, which is the built-in marketing strategy. Players accumulate power by
receiving points I reward them for spending time on the site, tweeting,
 sharing, tagging, liking, pinning, linking my stuff and naturally scrobbling my music!

These points can be spent on various forms of assignments presented on my site
by either myself or the crowd. These I will in return, of course, execute.
Basic gamification elements like leveling and badges will amplify the game
experience. People hooked will be so blinded by their virtual power,
that theyâ€™ll hardly realise how they are recruited for my army.


##Status
I am not much of a trapezist, but I have juggled my share of APIs in the
development of this project. The project has had several phases with working
elements. I used the project as a guide for honing my skills of the full
web application stack. Most of the django and python code found in my repository
[github.com/jessethegame](//github.com/jessethegame) are modularized parts of
that project. There is no running version at the moment.

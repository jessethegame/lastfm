#Jesse the Game
World domination. I have devised a schema for this specific purpose, which I am
not only willing to share with you, but offering you to be a part of. The
scheme is seeded by the premise that for world domination you need an army of
loyal minions. People.

People love music. People love games. People think computer science is magic.
These happen to be the three subjects I identify myself with. These are also
the three psychological hacks I intend to abuse in one entertainment experience:

The game is about power. The power to control a pop-music artist the way Mario
and Link dance to the tips of your fingers. I will expose myself as a playable
real-life game character, Jesse the Game; who has built the entire thing by
hand.

Power comes at a price. The mechanics of this game form a progressive attention
cycle, which is the built-in marketing strategy. Player accumulate power, by
receiving points I reward them for spending time on the site, tweeting,
 sharing, tagging, liking, pinning, linking my stuff and naturally scrobbling my music!

These points can be spent on various forms of assignments presented on my site
by either myself or the crowd. These I will in return, of course, execute.
Basic gamification elements like leveling and badges will amplify the game
experience. People hooked will be so blinded by their virtual power,
that theyâ€™ll hardly realise how they are recruited for my army.

I am not much of a trapezist, but I have juggled my share of APIs in the
development of this project.

#Welcome

## Dear reader!
You have safely landed on the homepage of a Wob Applicationâ„¢: a clone of
the official Last.fm Web Application and a token of my ability and dedication
to complement my Job Application for the Web Developer position at Last.fm.

##Who am I?
I am Jesse the Game, avid pop programmer and [aspiring world dominator](#/thegame).

##Why do I want this job?
* I am looking for a challenging environment to apply my knowledge and skills.
* I feel related to the specific cause of Last.fm. Scrobbling is a centerpiece
  of the domination scheme.
* I like the tone of voice and perceived vision. In my eyes, Last.fm does not
  seek to compete with existing services, but rather to enhance them.
* I see low-hanging fruit in client side structure, design unification and
  public api.
* I see great opportunities for next-leveling the user experience.

##Why does this job want me?
* I have a wide range of modern Web Development skills and knowledge,
  accrued by two years of full-time free personal focus on the latest standards
  and best practices for client and server-side.
* I am a code fetishist and get off on beautiful code in the zen of
  <abbr title="Keep It Subtle &amp; Sexy">KISS</abbr>.
* I am an artist next to a geek. I coined the term *pop programmer* to
  describe they way I feel about my profession. This means to you that I
  have a multidimensional view on the service and love to be creative with it.
* I am sensitive to aesthetics and keep up with trending style. I enjoy
  reading material on well-founded design theory.
* I am fascinated by human behaviour; my interest in UX reaches into the
  neurological domain.
* I have a fair hunch of the actual site, by reverse engineering it. That could
  prove a considerable headstart.

##What&rsquo;s on this site?

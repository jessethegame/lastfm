Hello last.fm,

I am Jesse the Game, aspiring world dominator. To become this I have devised a scheme, which I am not only willing to share with you, but offering you to be a part of. Keep reading.

The scheme is built upon a partial bachelor of computer science, a solid gaming history and a journey through the [Dutch X-Factor](http://youtube.com/jesseinliveshow) up to and including the live shows. This last feat allowed me to peek behind the scenes and inspired me to break the music industry; break pop-culture and achieve the first step towards domination: an army of loyal minions.

People love music. People love games. People think computer science is magic. These are the three psychological hacks I intend to abuse in one next level entertainment experience:

The game is about power. The power to control a pop-music artist the way Mario and Link dance to the tips of your fingers. I will expose myself as a playable real-life game character, Jesse the Game; who has built the entire framework.

Power comes at a price. The mechanics of this game form a progressive attention cycle, which is the built-in marketing strategy. For people to accumulate power, I will reward them with points for spending time on the site, tweeting, sharing, tagging, liking, pinning, linking my stuff and naturally scrobbling my music!

These points can be spent on various forms of assignments presented on my site by either myself or the crowd. These I will in return, of course, execute. Basic gamification elements like leveling and badges will amplify the game experience. People hooked will be so blinded by their virtual power, that they’ll hardly realise how they are recruited for my army.

> What’s in this for me?

Glad you thought that.

  1.  I could fill the Web Developer vacancy at your office, to make, say, £2500+ month (tooltip this, explaining it increases (and by how much) the longer they wait to click the stop button).
  2.  I could encourage people to install last.fm to get the points for scrobbling.
  3.  I might be willing to discuss a position as ambassador and bear a red flag to our marching army.
  4.  I could provide you with many other ways to exploit the powerful scrobble data.
  5.  I will bring cake along to the office for the job interview
  6.  I could help with anything dutch
